Share Price Predictor
========================================================

Location: https://datatraits.shinyapps.io/ShinyCourseProject

- Predicts share price value for any NYSE symbol (Well known Stocks: http://www.nasdaq.com/markets/most-active.aspx)
- Reactive Shiny Application
- Error Checking, Intuitive, Informative, 1 Year Forward Predicted Price
- Shows Historical Share Price in a nice Graphical User Interface
- Shows Current Price. If Predicted value is less than zero (try Symbol: LC), prints appropriate message

How Stock Price is Fetched
========================================================

- R Package **FinCal** provides method get.ohlc.google and get.ohlc.yahoo to download data for any publicly listed company
- Here we are using **get.ohlc.google** to download stock prices from Google Finance
- It provides historical data since 1st January 2013 till today (`r Sys.Date()`)
- We then use another method called **lineChart** to plot our graph every time user inputs a valid share symbol. It shows closing price (*close*) on the lineChart

How Share Price Data Looks Like
========================================================

- Showing Collected Data for Google (Share Symbol: GOOG)
```{r, echo=FALSE}
library(FinCal)
```
```{r}
get.ohlc.google('GOOG')
```

Prediction Modeling
========================================================

See previous slide for columns that we are referring here

- We use the **date** (changed to numeric value) as the predictor
- We use the **close** column as our predicted value column
- Using **stats::lm** we fit a linear model from our data downloaded from Google Finance
- Using the above model, we predict a value for 365 days from today
- If the predicted value is less than zero, we do not show negative value, instead we show an appropriate message
